# An agent-based network model of gonorrhea spread

# Description
This project was completed for an supervised research course in January of 2023. I collaborated with Donovan Roddy, Grace Barton, Max Kuntz, and Emmanuel Ameri under the supervision of Prof. Allison Luedtke.

## Use
The Jupyter notebook in this repo contains the code that was presented at the end of the course. Custom sexual networks may be used, a network may be randomly generated, or a sexual network described in Bearman et al., 2004.
